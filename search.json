    "title": "Handbook on Brexit and Migration",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Background\nMigration has played a crucial role in the United Kingdom’s decision to exit the EU, and Brexit has significantly impacted the whole nation, particularly the lives of EU nationals and their families living in the UK as well as British nationals residing in the other 27 EU countries. A significant body of social scientific literature has documented these processes since 2016. However, “Brexit”, far from representing solely a unique and historically specific event, raises various and more general questions about how states, political establishments, the EU, citizens and migrants navigate the challenges posed by radical socio-political transformations and “unsettling” events. It also highlights the changing relations between citizenship, identity and the sense of belonging. Analysing migration processes - past, present and future - through this broader analytical lens can tell us about the emerging social cleavages and tensions that will likely dominate the first half of the 21st century. This handbook proposes to pull together these various aspects to provide an authoritative interdisciplinary research-driven statement on the Brexit-migration nexus both as a historically conjunctural sociological experience and as a conceptual tool for framing changes in mobility patterns, policy and legal structures, and European politics.\nThe overall approach of the handbook - as reflected in its structure - is to take the reader on a journey, starting from the question of whether and how migration affected the UK’s decision to leave the European Union, through exploring the migration trends and policy frameworks shaped by the Brexit event, the social reactions to the yet unsettled changes engendered by the Brexit process, and finally the complex ways in which migrants of various backgrounds are affected by radical socio-political restructuring.\n\n\nProposed structure and contributors\nThe handbook aims to bring together a large variety of approaches and case-studies discussed in the emerging literature on migration in the context of Brexit. With this aim, it will seek shorter contributions from a large number of authoritative voices - both from established academics and young scholars - that are able to make a central analytical point based on original empirical research. It will comprise around 40 chapters of 5,000 words in length, adding up to approximately 200,000 words ( ~ 400 pages including references). The chapters of the handbook are organised in six parts, following an introduction by the editors. The introduction will be a full-length contribution outlining the main concepts and problems addressed in the book. Part 1 focuses on the central political event of the UK’s 2016 EU membership referendum, placing it in the broader ideological and political context of Euroscepticism dating back to the establishment of the European Union in the early 1990s and the changing demographics of migration to the UK over the following two decades. Through a selection of authoritative research-driven analyses, it aims to provide answers to the following contentious questions: in what sense can migration be held accountable for the vote for Brexit? How did Eurosceptic political actors manage to mobilise the “superdiversification” of migration to elicit a popular revolt against the perceived political elite driven by wider dissatisfaction with economic disenfranchisement following the global financial crisis of 2008, among both the “majority” and the “ethnic minority” British population? And what role did mass media - and the changing media landscape - play in these processes?\nPart 2 moves away from the immediate context of the EU referendum to provide a quantitative and legal-conceptual overview of the UK’s migration system in its relationship to Brexit. The chapters in this section will discuss in detail the main types of mobility which have figured prominently in public discourses and migration statistics and will discuss how these mobilities have changed and developed in post-Brexit UK\nParts 3 and 4 explore the various reactions given by non-citizens to the radical socio-political transformation posed by the Brexit process. Part 3 focuses on what in a Hirschmannian tradition could be called “voice” and “exit” reactions; on the one hand, Brexit has given rise to a new consciousness around the value and vulnerability of supranational rights and forms of belonging, leading to new forms of grass-roots political activism that provide empirical anchors for studying the formation of social movements; on the other hand, Brexit may have been a factor in decisions to return to the country of origin or move to a third country, and this part of the volume makes an empirically informed intervention in the study of return migration. Part 4 completes the Hirschmannian-inspired triptych with a focus on the strategies of those EU nationals who chose to remain in the UK following its rupture from the EU community of rights. The chapters in this part challenge the classical literature on migrant integration and assimilation through citizenship by emphasising the diversity and subtlety of practices and narrations of belonging. By reflecting on more durable emerging attitudinal patterns, on the ways in which the Brexit event was embedded into migrants’ life-courses, and on the views and lives of young people of EU migrant backgrounds, for whom Brexit forms an integral part in their socialisation and coming of age, these chapters discuss the Brexit-migration nexus as an important mechanism reshaping Britain’s social structure.\nPart 5 collects a number of case studies discussing the diversity of legal statuses, migration histories and regional identities, aiming to break down views of a monolithic EU citizenship experience both before and after Brexit. As such, Part 5 will critically engage with the issue of complex borders and boundary making as a result of the post-Brexit migration regime.\nFinally, Part 6 explores the legal frameworks and political-economic dynamics shaping the future of British nationals living in EU countries, as well as narrowing down on the experiences of Britons in a few selected EU countries.\n\n\nTentative Table of Contents\n\nIntroduction: definitions, concepts, problems\n\nPART 1: Migration and Brexit: a troubled relationship\n\nPolitical Euroscepticism, immigration and the long road to Brexit\nThe politics of Brexit in the context of migration\nMedia discourses on immigration in the Brexit debate\nEU enlargement (Turkey) and the Brexit debate\nCEE migration and the Brexit debate\nEthnic minorities, Euroscepticism and Brexit\n\nPART 2: Migration governance and Brexit: trends, legal frameworks and forecasts\n\nTransformations of the British migration system\nProbabilistic forecasts of migration post-Brexit\nThe European and British asylum systems before and after Brexit\nPoints-based immigration\nResidence rights and wrongs: settled status, unsettled lives?\nHigher education governance and student migration after Brexit\n\nPART 3: Voice and exit\n\nEU nationals’ political engagement/activism\nEthnic minorities and pro-EU grassroots activism\nMigration trends in the post-referendum interstitial period\nReturn migrants\nSkilled return migrants\nStudent migration/return intentions\n\nPART 4: Citizenship, belonging and embeddedness\n\nLegal integration and beyond\nWhat does Brexit tell us about citizenship?\nRacial geographies and histories of citizenship\nA new politics of belonging?\nLongitudinal life-course perspectives of EU migrants in the UK\nYoung people with EU migrant backgrounds\n\nPART 5: New and Old Hierarchies of privilege and belonging\nHierarchies of EU citizenship\n\nMigrant experiences before Brexit\nMigrant experiences post-Brexit\nEmotional costs of integration and hierarchies of privilege\nHighly skilled migrant experiences\n\nRegional identities and experiences\n\nEU nationals in Wales\nScottishness, Brexit and migration\nNorthern Ireland\n\nComplex statuses and identities\n\nEuropean naturalised third-country nationals in the UK\nLatin American onward migrants\nRace and coloniality\nEuropean naturalised third-country nationals in the UK\n\nPART 6: UK nationals in the EU\n\nBritish citizens living in the EU: a legal assessment\nBritish citizens living in the EU: a sociological overview\nBritons in Belgium\nBritons in Germany\nBritons in Germany\nBritons in France\nBritons in Spain\n\nConclusions\n\nThe state of the art and future directions in research on Brexit and migration\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

He argues\n    that to understand what is at stake in Hungary today, it is\n    necessary to direct the discussion towards the connection between\n    citizenship law and constitutional changes. Specifically, the new\n    citizenship law, being applied by Fidesz in 2010, has resulted in\n    what is described in the current volume as “the\n    anti-constitutionalist turn”. It is the end of Hungary’s\n    post-communist transition process to a liberal West-European\n    democracy favouring an “illiberal democracy”. Moreh, acknowledging\n    the ideological background of that transformation, focuses on how it\n    shifts the meaning of “political community” while discussing\n    extraterritorial ethnic citizenship by putting at its core the\n    principle of ius sanguinis. Only then will anyone who wants to\n    understand what is at stake in Hungary nowadays be able to create\n    the general framework of the Hungarian transformation: an ongoing\n    transition from previously adopted liberal values to the now popular\n    illiberal values. That transition can be better understood by\n    focusing on the clash between Hungary and the EU, the defender of\n    liberal values, while illiberal democracies, namely China and\n    Russia, have gained significance for Orbán’s government” (Kordas\n    \\textless a\n    href=“https://doi.org/10.1080/09668136.2021.1977036”\\textgreater2021\\textless/a\\textgreater).}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nMoreh, Chris. 2019. “Towards an Illiberal Extraterritorial\nPolitical Community?

The complex patterns of mobility and settlement which had characterised the British migration system for over six decades had begun shifting at the turn of the millennium and within a decade the country’s migration landscape changed dramatically. This change was one of the principal factors contributing to the outcome of the 2016 Referendum on European Union membership, which has triggered an ongoing ‘Brexit’ transition period with yet unsettled legal and political outcomes, but which nevertheless is already affecting the UK’s demography and policy landscape.

Source: Own elaboration based on data from the Annual Population Survey (Office for National Statistics 2019).  Notes: The chart traces back the five largest countries of birth in 2018. It also highlights the other top-five countries in the years when some of those in 2018 were not in the top five. For the end years (2000 and 2018) it spells out the the top-ten countries.\n\n\nToday’s migration landscape is significantly, although not unrecognisably, different to the one painted from the palette of the Windrush generation. It covers a much larger canvas of 9.3 million foreign-born and 6.1 million foreign-citizen residents, making up 14% and 6% of the total population respectively. At the end of 2018 the top five foreign citizenships held were Polish, Romanian, Indian, Irish and Italian. The five largest non-UK countries of birth: Poland, India, Pakistan, Romania and Ireland. It is particularly the recent diversification of countries of birth which shows the strongest sign of a restructuring migration system. As charted in Figure 1, by tracing back the development of the five largest birth-country groups over two decades we can spot three major turning points. In 2014–2015 for the first time an EU member state – Poland – became the largest non-UK country of birth, overtaking the number of Indian-born despite the latter’s also increasing number. Seven years earlier, in 2007–2008, Poland had jumped to the second place, having overtaken in the course of only three years all other major established foreign-born nationality group: Bangladesh, Germany, Pakistan and Ireland. The decline of Ireland as the major country of birth had been a slow process whose signs date back, as we have seen, to at least the 1970s, but which reached completion in 2003–2004 when it fell into second place after India for the first time. Three years earlier, in 2000–2001, the country’s landscape of foreign-born residents was still very similar to that of three decades before.\nThe main driver of this structural change is, of course, the development of intra-EU mobility patterns following the EU’s post-2004 eastern enlargements and the 2008–2009 European debt crisis. Poland is a representative of the eight Central-Eastern-European states that joined the EU and gained full rights on the British labour market in 2004 (EU8), while Romania became a formal member in 2007 together with Bulgaria (EU2), with the British labour market opening up to them in 2014. Ireland and Italy, on the other hand, have been dramatically affected by the debt crisis, plunging the latter in the top-ten list of foreign countries of birth, and halting the historic decline of the Irish-born community until very recently.\nAs Figure 2 shows, at the aggregate level the non-EU foreign-born population still significantly outnumbers the EU-born (right panel), while at the same time highlighting a somewhat earlier transition in the migration system in respect to foreign countries of citizenship (left panel): it was in 2012–2013 that the UK’s millennial migration complex shifted visibly and dramatically to a European one. At the same time, the latest data points depicted in the two Figures also signal that this newly emerged system might be on the edge of further change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Non-UK-born and non-UK-citizen residents in the United Kingdom, by EU/non-EU status (2004–2018).

    "section": "Towards a post-Brexit migration system",
    "text": "Towards a post-Brexit migration system\nThe 2016 referendum on EU membership has forcefully upset not only the UK’s political establishment but also its migration trends. In respect to the latter, according to some, the UK was “already in a post-Brexit era” in years before the country’s official exist date in 2020. If so, the new era will be characterised by an overall negative net migration trend from the EU27 (Figure 2), particularly the most established countries of origin such as Poland (Figure 1). The change will likely be a combination of demographic and legal processes, combining low immigration flows, increasing return movements and accelerating naturalisation rates. There is evidence that an openness to naturalising as British citizens has been a distinguishing feature among ‘new’ post-2004 EU migrants compared to those from the ‘old’ member states even before the EU referendum, yet one of the effect of the Brexit so far has been to drive up such legal integration overall. At the same time, the fact that in 2018 the number of UK residents who were born in Europe has also decreased (Figure 2, right panel) is clear sign that many are leaving the country.\nThose who decide to stay and be part of the UK’s post-Brexit journey will see their transition from being EU citizens with full rights of entry, settlement and economic membership in the UK to becoming either British citizens or ‘settled’ permanent residents. At the same time, the UK government is working on a new ‘skills-based immigration system’ to replace free movement rights with permits to fill specific labour-market shortages. These latest and ongoing developments, however, bring about a sense of déjà vu, reviving the spirit of the 1971 Immigration Act and the debates which preceded it. For the UK as a whole, the task will be to avoid replaying the painful economic stagnation of the 1970s. For the UK’s European-born residents, the aim will be to avoid the fate of the Windrush generation, many of whom had similarly arrived as free-moving citizens of a post-national equal membership organisation only to see their citizenship rights questioned seventy years later."

This\n    article explores the role of junctures within healthcare systems in\n    the connections migrants realize between healthcare systems and\n    sectors. The article argues that in a transnational context,\n    migrants enact these junctures by joining different levels of care\n    within the same sector, between sectors and across national borders.\n    In particular, the article explores how Polish migrants’ healthcare\n    seeking practices within and beyond national borders are enacted\n    given the features, availability and relationship between primary\n    and specialist care for how they are articulated between private and\n    public sectors. Methods: This article is based on the second phase\n    of a mixed-methods study on how Polish people in the UK manage their\n    health transnationally. The participants were purposefully sampled\n    from survey respondents (first phase) who identified as having a\n    long-term health condition or caring in a non-professional capacity\n    for someone who is chronically ill. Thirty-two semi-structured\n    audio-call interviews were conducted with Polish migrants living in\n    England between June and August 2020. Transcripts were analysed by\n    applying thematic coding. Results: Key findings include a mix of\n    dissatisfaction and satisfaction with primary care and general\n    satisfaction with specialist care. Coping strategies consisting in\n    reaching specialist private healthcare provided a way to access\n    specialist care at all or additionally, or to partially complement\n    primary care. When Polish private specialists are preferred, this is\n    due to participants’ availability of time and financial resources,\n    and to the specialists’ capacity to fulfil needs unmet within the\n    public healthcare sector in the UK. Conclusion: Polish migrants join\n    with their practices systems which are not integrated, and their\n    access is limited by the constraints implied in accessing paid\n    services in Poland. This shapes transnational healthcare practices\n    as relating mostly to routine and ad-hoc access to healthcare. These\n    practices impact not only the wellbeing of migrants and the\n    development of the private market but also the public health\n    provision of services.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nTroccoli, Giuseppe, Chris Moreh, Derek McGhee, and Athina Vlachantoni.\n2022. “At the Junctures of Healthcare: A Qualitative Study of\nPrimary and Specialist Service Use by Polish Migrants in\nEngland.” BMC Health Services Research 22 (1316): 1–12.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1186/s12913-022-08666-z."

Source: Own elaboration based on data from the Annual Population Survey (Office for National Statistics 2019).  Notes: The chart traces back the five largest countries of birth in 2018. It also highlights the other top-five countries in the years when some of those in 2018 were not in the top five. For the end years (2000 and 2018) it spells out the the top-ten countries.\n\n\nToday’s migration landscape is significantly, although not unrecognisably, different to the one painted from the palette of the Windrush generation. It covers a much larger canvas of 9.3 million foreign-born and 6.1 million foreign-citizen residents, making up 14% and 6% of the total population respectively. At the end of 2018 the top five foreign citizenships held were Polish, Romanian, Indian, Irish and Italian. The five largest non-UK countries of birth: Poland, India, Pakistan, Romania and Ireland. It is particularly the recent diversification of countries of birth which shows the strongest sign of a restructuring migration system. As charted in Figure 1, by tracing back the development of the five largest birth-country groups over two decades we can spot three major turning points. In 2014–2015 for the first time an EU member state – Poland – became the largest non-UK country of birth, overtaking the number of Indian-born despite the latter’s also increasing number. Seven years earlier, in 2007–2008, Poland had jumped to the second place, having overtaken in the course of only three years all other major established foreign-born nationality group: Bangladesh, Germany, Pakistan and Ireland. The decline of Ireland as the major country of birth had been a slow process whose signs date back, as we have seen, to at least the 1970s, but which reached completion in 2003–2004 when it fell into second place after India for the first time. Three years earlier, in 2000–2001, the country’s landscape of foreign-born residents was still very similar to that of three decades before.\nThe main driver of this structural change is, of course, the development of intra-EU mobility patterns following the EU’s post-2004 eastern enlargements and the 2008–2009 European debt crisis. Poland is a representative of the eight Central-Eastern-European states that joined the EU and gained full rights on the British labour market in 2004 (EU8), while Romania became a formal member in 2007 together with Bulgaria (EU2), with the British labour market opening up to them in 2014. Ireland and Italy, on the other hand, have been dramatically affected by the debt crisis, plunging the latter in the top-ten list of foreign countries of birth, and halting the historic decline of the Irish-born community until very recently.\nAs Figure 2 shows, at the aggregate level the non-EU foreign-born population still significantly outnumbers the EU-born (right panel), while at the same time highlighting a somewhat earlier transition in the migration system in respect to foreign countries of citizenship (left panel): it was in 2012–2013 that the UK’s millennial migration complex shifted visibly and dramatically to a European one. At the same time, the latest data points depicted in the two Figures also signal that this newly emerged system might be on the edge of further change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Non-UK-born and non-UK-citizen residents in the United Kingdom, by EU/non-EU status (2004–2018).

    "section": "Towards a post-Brexit migration system",
    "text": "Towards a post-Brexit migration system\nThe 2016 referendum on EU membership has forcefully upset not only the UK’s political establishment but also its migration trends. In respect to the latter, according to some, the UK was “already in a post-Brexit era” in years before the country’s official exist date in 2020. If so, the new era will be characterised by an overall negative net migration trend from the EU27 (Figure 2), particularly the most established countries of origin such as Poland (Figure 1). The change will likely be a combination of demographic and legal processes, combining low immigration flows, increasing return movements and accelerating naturalisation rates. There is evidence that an openness to naturalising as British citizens has been a distinguishing feature among ‘new’ post-2004 EU migrants compared to those from the ‘old’ member states even before the EU referendum, yet one of the effect of the Brexit so far has been to drive up such legal integration overall. At the same time, the fact that in 2018 the number of UK residents who were born in Europe has also decreased (Figure 2, right panel) is clear sign that many are leaving the country.\nThose who decide to stay and be part of the UK’s post-Brexit journey will see their transition from being EU citizens with full rights of entry, settlement and economic membership in the UK to becoming either British citizens or ‘settled’ permanent residents. At the same time, the UK government is working on a new ‘skills-based immigration system’ to replace free movement rights with permits to fill specific labour-market shortages. These latest and ongoing developments, however, bring about a sense of déjà vu, reviving the spirit of the 1971 Immigration Act and the debates which preceded it. For the UK as a whole, the task will be to avoid replaying the painful economic stagnation of the 1970s. For the UK’s European-born residents, the aim will be to avoid the fate of the Windrush generation, many of whom had similarly arrived as free-moving citizens of a post-national equal membership organisation only to see their citizenship rights questioned seventy years later."

A significant body of social scientific literature has documented these processes since 2016. However, “Brexit”, far from representing solely a unique and historically specific event, raises various and more general questions about how states, political establishments, the EU, citizens and migrants navigate the challenges posed by radical socio-political transformations and “unsettling” events. It also highlights the changing relations between citizenship, identity and the sense of belonging. Analysing migration processes - past, present and future - through this broader analytical lens can tell us about the emerging social cleavages and tensions that will likely dominate the first half of the 21st century. This handbook proposes to pull together these various aspects to provide an authoritative interdisciplinary research-driven statement on the Brexit-migration nexus both as a historically conjunctural sociological experience and as a conceptual tool for framing changes in mobility patterns, policy and legal structures, and European politics. The overall approach of the handbook - as reflected in its structure - is to take the reader on a journey, starting from the question of whether and how migration affected the UK’s decision to leave the European Union, through exploring the migration trends and policy frameworks shaped by the Brexit event, the social reactions to the yet unsettled changes engendered by the Brexit process, and finally the complex ways in which migrants of various backgrounds are affected by radical socio-political restructuring.\n                  \n            \n            \n\n        \n    \n    \n\n\nNo matching items"

Undertaking a thematic analysis on a large-N qualitative data set, the article aims to establish a data-driven typology of motivations inductively. This provides an intermediary analysis between qualitative depth and quantitative operationalisability, contributing to the existing literature on healthcare location preferences among transnationally connected social groups. This article finds that preferences for medical care in the country of origin are driven overwhelmingly by quality considerations, while preferences for the UK have more to do with convenience and financing. These perceptions result from negative personal experiences, lack of trust, and often concealed cultural differences, and the analysis identifies various nuances and connections between attitudes that previous in-depth qualitative studies could not systematise.\n              \n          \n        \n      \n  \n  \n  \n      \n        \n         [14]\n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Troccoli, Moreh, McGhee and Vlachantoni\n          \n            (2022)\n          \n          \"Diagnostic testing: therapeutic mobilities, social fields, and medical encounters in the transnational healthcare practices of Polish migrants in the UK\", \n          Journal of Migration and Health, vol. 5, issue 100100, pp. 1-9.\n        \n  \n        \n         \n           Abstract\n          \n             Text\n          \n          \n             Online\n          \n          \n          \n             Download citation\n          \n          \n            \n              While diagnostic tests are a fundamental component of contemporary medical practice they are seldom considered in studies of transnational healthcare. This article investigates the little-studied role played by diagnostic testing in the healthcare-seeking practices of migrants. It is concerned with the experiences of Polish migrants living in the UK and who access a variety of health services in their host and origin countries across the public and private sectors. We analyse data from semi-structured phone interviews conducted in 2020 with 32 adult Poles living in the UK who identified as having themselves, or non-professionally caring for someone with, a long-term health condition. The article contributes to the literature on migrants’ transnational healthcare practices by showing the centrality of diagnostic technology in their health management and sense-making through the creation, modification, and maintenance of ‘transnational social fields’ (Levitt and Schiller 2004). By emphasizing the role of tests in the patient-doctor relationship the article exposes the therapeutic outcomes of the mobilities of patients and tests as they intersect with physicians in multiple medical encounters.\n              \n          \n        \n      \n  \n  \n  \n      \n        \n         [13]\n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Troccoli, Moreh, McGhee and Vlachantoni\n          \n            (2022)\n          \n          \"Transnational healthcare as process: multiplicity and directionality in the engagements with healthcare among Polish migrants in the UK\", \n          Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, vol. 48, issue 9, pp. 1998-2017.\n        \n  \n        \n         \n           Abstract\n          \n             Text\n          \n          \n             Online\n          \n          \n          \n             Download citation\n          \n          \n            \n              Drawing on a mix-methods study comprised of an online questionnaire and semi-structured interviews, this article presents findings about the complexity and development in time of health service use by Polish migrants living in the United Kingdom. The article contributes to the analysis of transnational healthcare practices by operationalising a framework that considers service access within and beyond national borders, and between private and public sectors. By categorising engagements with healthcare providers based on their occurrence in time it argues for an understanding of transnational healthcare as a process. It finds that Polish migrants manage their health by accessing a variety of different providers. This complexity is also reflected in the multiple ways in which access to services with regards to specific health issues unfolds in time. By focusing the analysis on specific health issues rather than individuals the article finds that multiple ways to access healthcare services coexist for the same participant, who does not necessarily move towards particular healthcare providers unitarily, but adopts ad hoc solutions on the basis of their experiences within specific medical areas. Understanding migrants’ patterns of accessing healthcare can contribute to more effective policy solutions supporting migrants in the UK today.\n              \n          \n        \n      \n  \n  \n  \n      \n        \n         [12]\n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Troccoli, Moreh, McGhee and Vlachantoni\n          \n            (2022)\n          \n          \"At the junctures of healthcare: a qualitative study of primary and specialist service use by Polish migrants in England\", \n          BMC Health Services Research, vol. 22, issue 1316, pp. 1-12.\n        \n  \n        \n         \n           Abstract\n          \n             Text\n          \n          \n             Online\n          \n          \n          \n             Download citation\n          \n          \n            \n              Background:\n Polish people are the biggest migrant group in the UK and the scholarship shows that they are attentive to their healthcare needs and seek to fulfil them by using various services both within and outside the British public healthcare system. This article explores the role of junctures within healthcare systems in the connections migrants realize between healthcare systems and sectors. The article argues that in a transnational context, migrants enact these junctures by joining different levels of care within the same sector, between sectors and across national borders. In particular, the article explores how Polish migrants’ healthcare seeking practices within and beyond national borders are enacted given the features, availability and relationship between primary and specialist care for how they are articulated between private and public sectors.\n\nMethods:\n This article is based on the second phase of a mixed-methods study on how Polish people in the UK manage their health transnationally. The participants were purposefully sampled from survey respondents (first phase) who identified as having a long-term health condition or caring in a non-professional capacity for someone who is chronically ill. Thirty-two semi-structured audio-call interviews were conducted with Polish migrants living in England between June and August 2020. Transcripts were analysed by applying thematic coding.\n\nResults:\n Key findings include a mix of dissatisfaction and satisfaction with primary care and general satisfaction with specialist care. Coping strategies consisting in reaching specialist private healthcare provided a way to access specialist care at all or additionally, or to partially complement primary care. When Polish private specialists are preferred, this is due to participants’ availability of time and financial resources, and to the specialists’ capacity to fulfil needs unmet within the public healthcare sector in the UK.\n\nConclusion:\n Polish migrants join with their practices systems which are not integrated, and their access is limited by the constraints implied in accessing paid services in Poland. This shapes transnational healthcare practices as relating mostly to routine and ad-hoc access to healthcare. These practices impact not only the wellbeing of migrants and the development of the private market but also the public health provision of services.\n              \n          \n        \n      \n  \n  \n  \n      \n        \n         [11]\n        \n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Danjo and Moreh\n          \n            (2020)\n          \n          \"Complementary schools in the global age: A multi-level critical analysis of discourses and practices at Japanese Hoshuko in the UK\", \n          Linguistics and Education, vol. 60, issue 100870, pp. 1-12.\n        \n  \n        \n         \n           Abstract\n          \n             Text\n          \n          \n             Online\n          \n          \n          \n             Download citation\n          \n          \n            \n              Hoshuko are Japanese government approved complementary schools operating in many countries outside Japan and providing Japanese-medium education.

This article explores how the Japanese government, hoshuko , as well as the teachers and parents accommodate to the challenges and opportunities of diversification, looking specif- ically at the context of the United Kingdom. It combines discourse-analytic conceptual tools and ethno- graphic methods to explore discursive practices at the macro-level of governmental policy, the meso–level of institutional policies of nine UK hoshuko , and the micro-level of situated practices at one UK school. We demonstrate how governmental discourses pursue specific coercive aims using discursive strategies, and how these are recontextualised in institutional and individual practices. At each level, we also identify mechanisms through which the official dominant discourse is negotiated.

Focusing on the United Kingdom and combining an analysis of secondary administrative data and primary online survey data (N = 1,413), this article examines practices and attitudes toward such legal integration in the context of the 2016 EU Referendum among five major EU nationality groups. The analysis reveals that British citizenship is the main legal mechanism of integration among intra-EU migrants in the United Kingdom and that while there is continuity in this respect with pre-Brexit processes, Brexit also has a strong but differential effect as a driver of legal integration.

This approach considers migrants’ attitudes towards specific ‘civic integration’ measures in a medium-term time frame, as well as in the new context created by the UK’s vote to leave the EU. Based on the quantitative analysis of original survey data, we investigate the factors behind Polish migrants’ migration strategies, and we argue that basic socio-economic and demographic factors are inadequate, on their own terms, to explain future migration and civic integration plans. Instead, we find that aspects such as interest in and awareness of one’s rights, as well as anxieties about the ability to maintain one’s rights in the future are stronger determinants.\n              \n          \n        \n      \n  \n  \n  \n      \n        \n        \n          [5]\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Moreh\n          \n            (2016)\n          \n          \"Inhabiting heritage: living with the past in the Albayzín of Granada\", \n          Open Library of Humanities, vol. 2, issue 1, pp. 1-33.\n        \n  \n        \n         \n           Abstract\n          \n             Text\n          \n          \n             Online\n          \n          \n          \n             Download citation\n          \n          \n            \n              This paper is an exploration of the ideological struggles reflected in the urban conflicts taking place in an inhabited World Heritage site, the ‘old Moorish’ neighbourhood of Albayzín in Granada. Centring its discussion on a theorisation of ‘heritage’, the article introduces the concept of ‘heritagification’ as a useful way of understanding the local historical-political dimensions of urban conflict in populated World Heritage Sites, defining it as the localised material and empirical manifestation of a universal ideological principle. In the Albayzín, the article argues, the main struggle develops around providing the neighbourhood with a future meaning, function and inhabitants. Competing perspectives are heavily influenced by visions of the past, the main divide stretching between Muslim and Christian interpretations of the neighbourhood’s historic heritage.

The author estimates the current number of first generation Hungarian migrants in the United Kingdom to be at around 86,000, more than one third of whom reside in London. Hungarian migrants are also shown to be young, balanced in terms of gender, and mobile – with more than half of the migrants registering for National Insurance Numbers re-migrating in less than two years.

The data analysed in the paper also suggests that migration from Hungary is likely to intensify in the years to come, and that the freedoms and rights conferred by EU membership are allowing a highly complex configuration of migration patterns and modalities, urging a reconsideration of the dialectic between temporality and settlement.\n              \n          \n        \n      \n  \n  \n  \n      \n        \n        \n          [2]\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Moreh\n          \n            (2014)\n          \n          \"A Decade of Membership: Hungarian Post-Accession Mobility to the United Kingdom\", \n          Central and Eastern European Migration Review, vol. 3, issue 2, pp. 79-104.\n        \n  \n        \n         \n           Abstract\n          \n             Text\n          \n          \n             Online\n          \n          \n          \n             Download citation\n          \n          \n            \n              This paper examines Hungarian migration to the United Kingdom following EU accession.

Empirically, it aims to complement the study of status in the localities of origin, with a focus on status in the ‘communities’ at the destination. The paper suggests the existence of a developmental line in differentiation practices, from the most basic strategies of economic status improvement through the complex mechanisms of ‘prestige’ status recovery to the first occupational advancements with an associated status relevant in the receiving society, shaped by internal factors and external structural forces. Based on this, the paper proposes the model of social differentiation as a schematic tool that could become helpful in examining other phenomena related to migrant communities, especially their ‘adaptation possibilities’.\n              \n          \n        \n      \n  \n  \n\n\nNo matching items"

Explicitly zemiological appreciations of migratory phenomena have generally limited themselves to addressing the effects of exclusionary immigration and asylum policies targeting vulnerable migrants. This chapter aims instead to provide a broad overview of a great variety of migration processes. It argues that migration is a complex phenomenon rife with paradoxes and this often allows it to become a vehicle for social harms across different societies. It describes and examines critically three dimensions of migration-related harms: those associated with the causes of migration, those involved in migration itself and the harms associated with the management of migration by nation-states.\n             \n          \n        \n      \n  \n  \n  \n      \n        \n        \n          [3]\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Moreh\n          (2019)\n          \"Towards an illiberal extraterritorial political community?

He argues that to understand what is at stake in Hungary today, it is necessary to direct the discussion towards the connection between citizenship law and constitutional changes. Specifically, the new citizenship law, being applied by Fidesz in 2010, has resulted in what is described in the current volume as ‘the anti-constitutionalist turn’. It is the end of Hungary’s post-communist transition process to a liberal West-European democracy favouring an ‘illiberal democracy’. Moreh, acknowledging the ideological background of that transformation, focuses on how it shifts the meaning of ‘political community’ while discussing extraterritorial ethnic citizenship by putting at its core the principle of ius sanguinis. Only then will anyone who wants to understand what is at stake in Hungary nowadays be able to create the general framework of the Hungarian transformation: an ongoing transition from previously adopted liberal values to the now popular illiberal values. That transition can be better understood by focusing on the clash between Hungary and the EU, the defender of liberal values, while illiberal democracies, namely China and Russia, have gained significance for Orbán’s government\" (Kordas 2021).\n             \n          \n        \n      \n  \n  \n  \n      \n        \n        \n          [2]\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Moreh\n          (2016)\n          \"Magyar bevándorlók az Egyesült Királyságban\",\n          pp. 68-71\n          in Blaskó Zs and Fazekas K (eds.)\n          Munkaerőpiaci Tükör 2015.\n          Budapest: MTA, Közgazdaságtudományi Intézet\n        \n        \n        \n        \n           Abstract\n          \n          \n             Text\n          \n          \n             Online\n          \n          \n          \n             Download citation\n          \n          \n            \n              \n             \n          \n        \n      \n  \n  \n  \n      \n        \n        \n          [1]\n        \n      \n      \n        \n          Moreh\n          (2016)\n          \"Hungarian immigrants in the United Kingdom\",\n          pp. 69-72\n          in Blaskó Zs and Fazekas K (eds.)\n          The Hungarian Labour Market 2016.\n          Budapest: Institute of Economics, Centre for Economic and Regional Studies, Hungarian Academy of Sciences\n        \n        \n        \n        \n           Abstract\n          \n          \n             Text\n          \n          \n             Online\n          \n          \n          \n             Download citation\n          \n          \n            \n              \n             \n          \n        \n      \n  \n  \n  \n\nNo matching items"

The complex patterns of mobility and settlement which had characterised the British migration system for over six decades had begun shifting at the turn of the millennium and within a decade the country’s migration landscape changed dramatically. This change was one of the principal factors contributing to the outcome of the 2016 Referendum on European Union membership, which has triggered an ongoing ‘Brexit’ transition period with yet unsettled legal and political outcomes, but which nevertheless is already affecting the UK’s demography and policy landscape.  This brief magazine article summarises the main changes undergone in the UK's migration system since the second half of the twentieth century.

    "text": "Extending our research conducted under the ‘UK in a Changing Europe’ initiative, this project focuses on the health and care practices of EU migrants. It is crucial to broaden our knowledge of such practices and assess how they are likely to change in light of the uncertainty with regards to international mobility brought by Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIt is important to understand the attitudes and experiences of Polish nationals since they constitute the biggest group of EU (and non-British) population in the UK. Like other EU citizens, Poles are prone to travel back to their country of origin for medical treatment and they often resort to the private sector, in Poland or the UK. As part of this project, we have collected national level primary data on how Poles in the UK manage their health by travelling and by accessing public and private services. In particular, the project focuses on those who are likely to be in continuous contact with health service providers because they are affected by, or are caring for someone with, a long-term condition or disability.\nMethodologically, the project consists of two interrelated phases. Firstly, between November 2019 and January 2020, we have gathered both quantitative and qualitative data from 510 Poles living in the UK by the means of an online questionnaire. Informed by this, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with thirty-two survey respondents. We are currently analysing our data in order to broaden how transnational healthcare is conceptualized, develop our knowledge of health-seeking behaviours that show migrant’s engagements with both states and markets, and deepen our understanding of intergenerational caring practices.\nWe have also received further funding to collect follow-up interviews with previous interview participants during summer 2021. This will allow us to better understand the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic year on the lives of Poles living in the UK."
